# Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository of Shubh Patel

This repository contains 3 beginner-friendly and widely-used machine learning projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 
Each project demonstrates key ML concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Projects Included

1. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  
   A classification model to predict the species of iris flowers using features like petal length, sepal width, etc.

2. 📈 Sales Prediction  
   A regression-based ML model that forecasts sales based on past data and features such as product type, pricing, etc.

3. 📧 Email Spam Detection  
   A natural language processing (NLP) project that classifies emails as spam or not using text vectorization and classification algorithms.

## ⚠️ Note:

➡️ Please ensure that the dataset files are stored in the same folder where the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) is saved.  
✅ I have already placed copies of each dataset in both the notebook folder and a separate data folder for convenience.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook for the project.
3. Make sure the dataset file is present in the same directory.
4. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to explore and understand the model.
